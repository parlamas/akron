            <div class="box"><p>The Danish people who will read this book, not only will they improve their English dramatically, but they will also make sense of the pitfalls in the Danish grammar as it is presented in Danish grammar books.<p>
            On the other hand, those readers who study Danish will see their learning curve get substantially steeper, thus speeding up the process of learning Danish.</div><p>

            First off, let us distinguish between the <b>what</b> and the <b>how</b>.<p>

            Let us say we intend to embark on a study of the <i>liver</i>. The <i>dialectical</i> way to go about it is to first <span class="b">(a)</span>define the liver, the <b>what</b>, and then <span class="b">(b)</span>study the <b>how</b>, that is the inner workings of the liver or how the liver works and to what end.<p>

            Our being able to formulate a valid definition does not mean we know the inner workings of the concept defined.<p>

            The definition of the <i>liver</i> might be a couple of lines long but its inner workings are hunderds of thousands, if not millions, lines long.<p>

            However, despite the huge difference in the quantity of text between the <i>what</i> and the <i>how</i>, they are equally important, especially when the concept defined does not have a visual representation like, for example, <i>Justice</i>.<p>

            The definition serves to bring into sharp focus the object of our study. If our definition is wrong, we will end up studying some other concept instead. If, for example, our definition of <i>Justice</i> were really the definition of <i>punishment</i>, then we would be studying <i>punishment</i> instead of <i>Justice</i>.

            Therefore, the stakes involved in formulating a valid definition are really high.<p>

                <center>&bull; &bull; &bull;</center><p>

            In this book we are going to talk about and study in depth the grammar of <b>adverb clauses</b>, both in English and Danish, focusing on the similarities and differences between the 2 languages with respect to them, that is to adverb clauses.<p>

            But if we are to be successful in our endeavour, we had better consider first a number of issues before we get to the point of actually studying the adverb clauses.<p>

            However, let it not escape us that studying grammar means studying language as well. It makes a lot of sense, then, to start by defining <i>language</i> and <i>grammar</i>, for it would not serve us well if we started to study them without having a clue about their nature.<p>

            But even before we define language and grammar, shouldn't we define, well, the term <i>definition</i>?<p>

            And, what about our methodology?<p>

            The methodology we are going to follow in writing this book is based on <i>Dialectics</i> and <i>Horistics</i>.<p>

            Would it not then be a good idea to start by first defining <i>Dialectics</i> and <i>Horistics</i> instead?<p>

            Let us do just that.<p>

            Starting, then, in logical order, that is from top to bottom, we are going to define <span class="b">(a)</span>dialectics, <span class="b">(b)</span>horistics, <span class="b">(d)</span>definition, <span class="b">(e)</span>language, and <span class="b">(f)</span>grammar.<p>

            <span class="def">def. 1</span> <b>Dialectics</b> is asking the <u>right</u> questions and providing the <u>right</u> answers with an eye to uncovering the truth regarding the issue under examination. (Socrates in Plato's Cratylus 390c)<p>

            In everyday language, this refers to the ability to <i>think straight</i> or to <i>avoid making mistakes</i> when we think critically. Arriving at a conclusion involves, inevitably, asking questions and providing answers. If we ask the right questions and provide the right answers, we will arrive at the right conclusion and thus reap benefits; if not, we will arrive at the wrong conclusion and thus suffer the consequences.<p>

            <span class="def">def. 2</span> <b>Horistics</b> is the art of defining. (Isidoros Parlamas 1980)<p>

            It should be mentioned at this point that horistics is the cornerstone of dialectics.<p>

            Meaningfully, the word <i>horizon</i> has the same origin as the word <i>horistics</i>, the Greek verb <span class="br"><b>ΟΡΙΖΕΙΝ / ὁρίζειν</b></span> (horizein), which means <i>to delineate</i>. Each definition has its own <i>horizon</i> or <i>delineation</i>, and it had better not spill over to other horizons of adjacent concepts because, if it does, then our definition is invalid.<p>

            <span class="def">def. 3</span> A <b>definition</b> is a set of properties which <u>exclusively</u> identifies a unique concept. (Isidoros Parlamas 1980)<p>

            For a statement to qualify as a definition, it must fulfill a number or requirements, one of which is that only 1 unique concept can fit into it.<p>

            The timing is right to define "concept" as well.<p>

            <span class="def">def. 4</span> A <b>concept</b> is a representation of a given definition. (Isidoros Parlamas 1980)<p>

            For instance, if we define the "horse," the way opens to consider different reprentations of the term defined. We can think of the concept of <span class="b">(a)</span>a real horse, the concept of <span class="b">(b)</span>a horse on a computer screen, the concept of <span class="b">(c)</span>a horse in a physical photo, <span class="b">(d)</span>in a physical painting, the concept of <span class="b">(e)</span>the word "horse" itself et al.<p>

            Time to define language.<p>

            We'd better be careful here not to confuse <i>interaction</i> with language. So, what is language?<p>

            <span class="def">def. 5</span> <b>Language</b> is communication governed by grammar. (Isidoros Parlamas 1980)<p>

            What is grammar?<p>

            <span class="def">def. 6</span> <b>Grammar</b> is the set of rules that governs a language. (Isidoros Parlamas 1980)<p>

            Now, armed with this set of instrumental definitions of very basic concepts, we are better equipped to proceed further.<p>
            
                    <center>&bull; &bull; &bull;</center><p>

            <center>A WORD ON CONCEPTS &bull; EN KOMMENTER OM BEGREBER</center><p>

    Literally <b>everything</b> that exists, be it animate or inanimate, is, among other things, a concept. Definitions describe concepts. All concepts have a representation, be it physical, visual, literal, or conceptual.<p>

    For instance, an <span class="b">apple</span>, a concrete noun, can be represented in 4 objective ways:

<div>
    <ol>
        <li><b>physical</b> (real apples) <span style="position:relative; top:15px; border-radius:10%;"><img src="aaa.png" width="40" height="40" style="vertical-align: bottom"></span><p>
        <li><b>visual</b> (on a screen or in a photo or in a painting): <span style="position:relative; top:10px; border-radius:10%;"><img src="aaa.avif" width="62" height="42" style="vertical-align: bottom"></span><p>
        <li><b>lexical</b> (the word): apple<p>
        <li><b>conceptual</b> (definition): <b>An apple</b> is typically round or oblong fruit with smooth or slightly textured skin. The skin color can vary depending on the variety and can be shades of red, green, yellow, or a combination thereof. Apples have a firm and juicy flesh and their taste can range from sweet to tart.
    </ol>
</div><p>

    But <span class="b">kindness</span>, an abstract noun,  can be represented only in 2 objective ways:<p>

        <ol start=5>
        <li><b>lexical</b> (the word): kindness<p>
        <li><b>conceptual</b> (definition): <span class="def">def. 7</span> <b>Kindness</b> is a positive quality or characteristic demonstrated through compassionate and considerate behavior towards others.
    </ol><p>

    The thing to understand here is that <span class="b">(a)</span>since represenations of concepts are <b>something</b> and <span class="b">(b)</span>since <b>everything</b> is, among other things, a concept, <span class="b">(c)</span>it follows that representations of concepts are also concepts.<p>

    We can therefore refer to <span class="b">(a)</span>the concept of the physical representation of an apple or <span class="b">(b)</span>the concept of the lexical  representation of an apple and so on.<p>

    Some concepts are universal while others are not. For example, lexical representations, that is words or vocabulary, are not universal because they are language dependent, while conceptual represenations are universal. Indeed, the lexical representation of an <span style="position:relative; top:10px; border-radius:10%;"><img src="aaa.avif" width="62" height="42" style="vertical-align: bottom"></span> in English is <span class="b">apple</span>, while in Danish is <span class="b">æble</span>; however, conceptual representations are universal.<p>

        <center>&bull; &bull; &bull;</center><p>


        <center>A WORD ON LANGUAGE &bull; EN KOMMENTER OM SPROG</center><p>


A language can be broken down into <span class="b">(a)</span>lexicon (words or vocabulary), <span class="b">(b)</span>phonetics (pronunciation) rules, <span class="b">(c)</span>punctuation rules, <span class="b">(d)</span>syntax (word order) rules, and <span class="b">(e)</span>morphology rules, part of which are periphrases.<p>

<span class="b">(f)</span>There are far more concepts than words and <span class="b">(g)</span>each word represents only one concept at a time and <span class="b">(h)</span>each concept has a definition and <span class="b">(i)</span>there is only one valid definition for each concept and <span class="b">(j)</span>there is not a single word which represents only one concept.<br><span style="font-size:9pt;">(Isidoros Parlamas &bull; Applied Dialectics & Horistics)</span><p>

    Let me elaborate on the statement above:<p>

    <span class="b">(f)</span><i>There are far more concepts than words</i><p>
    For every word and in every language there are at least 2 concepts associated with it. As an example, let us think of <b>water</b>. How many concepts does <b>water</b> represent? Well, let's see how many of them we can think of off hand.<p>

            
    
        <span class="sent">sent. 1</span> I drink 2 liters of <b>water</b> every day. (H<sub style="font-size:8pt;">2</sub>O &rarr; uncountable noun)<br>
        <span class="dan">dansk 1</span> <span class="k">Jeg drikker 2 liter vand hver dag.</span><p>
        <span class="sent">sent. 2</span> My eyes <b>water</b> when I see homeless children. (intransitive verb)<br>
        <span class="dan">dansk 2</span> <span class="k">Mine øjne løber i vand, når jeg ser hjemløse børn.</span><p>
        <span class="sent">sent. 3</span> My mouth <b>waters</b> when I smell fresh fish. (intransitive verb)<br>
        <span class="dan">dansk 3</span> <span class="k">Min mund løber i vand, når jeg lugter frisk fisk.</span><p>
        <span class="sent">sent. 4</span> I <b>water</b> my garden  once a week. (transitive verb)<br>
        <span class="dan">dansk 4</span> <span class="k">Jeg vander min have en gang om ugen.</span><p>
    

    We see that <b>water</b> represents at least 4 different concepts.<p>

    <span class="b">(g)</span><i>Each word represents only one concept at a time</i><p>
    But even though <b>water</b> represents various concepts, it represents <u>only one concept at a time</u>. As you can see, in each of the 4 sentences above, <b>water</b> represents only one concept. For example, in sentence 1, it represents only H<sub style="font-size:8pt;">2</sub>O.<p>

    <span class="b">(h)</span><i>each concept has a definition</i><p>
        The definition of <b>water</b> in <span class="sent">sent. 1</span> above is its chemical formula: <span class="def">def. 8</span> <span class="b">H<sub style="font-size:8pt;">2</sub>O.</span><p>
        The definition of <b>water</b> in <span class="sent">sent. 2</span> above is <span class="b"> <span class="def">def. 9</span> overflowing of the eyes with tears.</span><p>
        The definition of <b>water</b> in <span class="sent">sent. 3</span> above is <span class="b"> <span class="def">def. 10</span> the production of an abnormally large amount of saliva in the mouth.</span><p>
        The definition of <b>water</b> in <span class="sent">sent. 4</span> above is <span class="b"> <span class="def">def. 11</span> providing moisture to plants and/or trees by applying water to the soil.</span><p>


        <span class="b">(i)</span><i>there is only one valid definition for each concept</i><p>


    Of course, anyone can attempt to define a concept. If, for example, we ask 10 people to define <b>Justice</b>, we will most probably end up with 10 different definitions, of which, most probably, none will be apposite.<p>

    <b>Justice</b>, just like all other words, represents more than one concept, but each specific concept of <b>justice</b> has only one valid definition.<p>

    It takes a lot of training in <i>Dialectics</i> and <i>Horistics</i> to be able to come up with valid definitions.<p>

    <span class="b">(j)</span><i>there is not a single word which represents only one concept</i><p>
    This may sound impossible, but it is true. Even words such as <b>and</b> represent more than one concept.<p>

        Let us take a look.<p>

    
        <span class="sent">sent. 5</span> He ate two peaches <b>and</b> drank one coke.<p>
            <span class="rel">Rel. 1</span> (cummulative relationship &bull; <b>and</b> here conveys the concept of increase or addition)<p>
        <span class="sent">sent. 6</span> George invited Helen to dinner, <b>and</b> he didn't pay for it.<p>
            <span class="rel">Rel. 2</span> (relationship of contrast &bull; <b>and</b> here means <b>but</b>)<p>
        <span class="sent">sent. 7</span> Jill was anxious about her date, <b>and</b> she canceled it.<p>
            <span class="rel">Rel. 3</span> (cause-and-effect relationship &bull; <b>and</b> here means <b>so</b>)
    <p>

        You get the idea...<p>

            <center>&bull; &bull; &bull;</center><p>


<center>PARTS OF SPEECH &bull; DELE AF TALE</center><p>

            <span style="text-align:justify;">
    Crucial <b>axiom</b>: <span class="b"><span class="r">(a)</span>Parts of Speech are concepts. <span class="r">(b)</span>There are 10 Parts of Speech and <span class="r">(c)</span>each word belongs in at least one of them. Parts of Speech are <span class="r">(d)</span><b>language independent</b>, meaning that they are <span class="r">(e)</span>lexicon independent, <span class="r">(f)</span>punctuation independent, <span class="r">(g)</span>syntax independent, <i><span class="r">(h)</span>morphology<span style="color:black;">*</span> independent</i>, and <span class="r">(i)</span>periphrasis<span style="color:black;">**</span> independent</i>.<p>

    A verb, then, remains a <b>verb</b> in all languages regardless of the lexicon or punctuation or syntax or morphology or periphrasis involved.<p>

    You really &nbsp; need to understand that while <b>lexicon, syntax, punctuation</b>, <b>morphology</b>, and <b>periphrasis</b> are language dependent, <span class="r">concepts, and by extension, Parts of Speech, are not</span>. That is to say that Parts of Speech are <u>universal</u>.<hr>
    *<b>morphology</b> refers to internal structure and formation of words in a language, which involves, among other things, prefixes, suffixes, inflection, declension, conjugation, and periphrases. In English, we <b>decline</b> nouns, adjectives, and pronouns and we <b>conjugate</b> verbs. For instance, the subject of verbs in English is indicated by nouns or subject pronouns: <span class="sent">sent. 8</span> <i><b>Helen</b> works</i> or <i><b>she</b> works</i>, but in Spanish, it is indicated by the ending of the verb as the verb is conjugated: <i>Helena trabaj<span class="r">a</span></i> or <i>ella trabaj<span class="r">a</span></i> or <i>trabaj<span class="r">a</span></i>; <i>Helena y Juan trabaj<span class="r">an</span></i> or <i>ellos trabaj<span class="r">an</span></i> or trabaj<span class="r">an</span>.<p>

    **<b>perifrasis</b>, plural <b>periphrases</b>, is part of morphology and refers to polylexical (multi-worded) forms of Parts of Speech. For example, <i>to be fond of</i> is a periphrasis of <i>to like</i>, but they are both verbs and their meaning is roughly the same. <i>Even though</i> is a periphrasis of <i>although</i>, but they are both conjunctions and their meaning is roughly the same. Periphrases do not always occur in pairs. For example, <i>look forward to</i> does not have a monolexical (single-worded) counterpart.<hr>

            

        For instance, <b>working hard</b> is a concept. <span class="sent">sent. 9</span> <b>They work hard</b> is said in all countries, irrespective of lexicon, punctuation, syntax, morphology or periphrases. So, on planet Earth, in this specific example, <b>they</b> will always be a subject pronoun, <b>work</b> will always be a verb, and <b>hard</b> will always be an adverb.<p>

        Let us see this same sentence in a few different languages:<p>

            
                <b>English:</b><span class="fu"><b>They</b></span> <span class="b">work</span> <span class="r">hard</span>.<p>

                <b>Danish:</b> <span class="fu"><b>De</b></span> <span class="b">arbejder</span> <span class="r">hårdt</span>.<p>

                <b>Modern Greek:</b> <span class="fu"><b>Αυτοί</b></span> <span class="b">εργάζονται</span> <span class="r">σκληρά</span>.<p>

                <b>Spanish:</b> <span class="fu"><b>Ellos</b></span> <span class="b">trabajan</span> <span class="r">duro</span>.<p>

                <b>Polish:</b> <span class="fu"><b>Oni</b></span> <span class="b">pracują</span> <span class="r">ciężko</span>.<p>

                <b>Russian:</b> <span class="fu"><b>Они</b></span> <span class="r">много</span> <span class="b">работают</span>. (The syntax is different here, but Parts of Speech remain unaffected.)<p>

                <b>Mandarin Chinese:</b> <span class="fu"><b>他们</b></span> <span class="b">工作</span> <span class="r">努力</span>。<p>

            <p>

            We can see that in every single language above, <span class="fu"><b>fuchsia</b></span> is <u>the subject pronoun</u>, <span class="b"><b>blue</b></span> is <u>the verb</u> and <span class="r"><b>red</b></span> is <u>the adverb</u>, which demonstrates neatly that Parts of Speech are universal.<p>

    Parts of Speech are, then, strictly <b>function dependent</b>, which means that each Part of Speech plays a distinct nonvariable role in the clause; in other words, the role of verbs is invariably the same, the role of nouns is invariably the same, and so on.<p>

    The role that each Part of Speech has in clauses is spelled out in its own definition, meaning the definition of each Part of Speech is really the description of its role in the clause.
    

                    <center>&bull; &bull; &bull;</center><p>


        These are the 10 Parts of Speech in alphabetical order:

        There are also a handful of words, usually less than 10, called <b>particles</b>, which do not fit into any of the definitions of the Parts of Speech. For example, in English, the word <b>to</b>, when part of the infinitive, is sometimes, but not always, a <b>particle</b>.<p>

    Mostly directly, but also indirectly, Parts of Speech are noun-centered, that is nouns are the sun of the solar system of the Parts of Speech. All other 9 Parts of Speech revolve around nouns.<p>

    <center>A LITTLE HISTORY</center><p>

        Of course, everything started wnen the <b>Creator</b> created the cosmos.<p>

        But here, on planet Earth, <b>civilization</b>, not architecture, not agriculture, not irrigation, not know-how of any sort, but civilization started with Socrates (469 - 399 BC) in Athens.<p>

        Socrates was the first to be concerned primarily, both in his private and public discourse, about Justice and Ethics.<p>

        It was Socrates who introduced to the world the Dialectical Methodology of Reasoning, the Dialectics, which did away once and for all with superstition, bias, and economic and social discrimination, thus giving a tremendous boost to philosophy and social politics.<p>

        The way Socrates lived and died has been <b>anathema</b> to this day to all strongmen, fascists, dictators, and tyrants from China to Chile...and beyond. But it also has been the guding light of Freedom and Justice for various peoples, but first and foremost for the Scandinavian peoples.<p>

        Most of the Scandinavians may not know it, but the way they have lived their lives for the last 150 years is nearly totally aligned with the Socratic view on social politics and political ethos.<p>

            <center>&bull; &bull; &bull;</center><p>

        Then, it was <span class="b">(a)</span>Plato, Socrates' student, and then <span class="b">(b)</span>Aristotle, Plato's student, and finally <span class="b">(c)</span>Alexander the Great, Aristotle's student.<p>

        The first university ever, the Academy, was founded by Plato in Athens and lasted about 1000 years; the second universsity, the Lyceum, was founded by Aristotle in Athens and lasted about 300 years. As for Alexander the Great, he was the one who, through his conquests in Asia and North Africa, spread the Classical Greek Civilization from the Atlantic ocean to India and caused the phenomenon called <i>Hellenization</i>, which has been transforming the whole world ever since.<p> 

        <span class="b">Plato</span>, in Plato's Cratylus, and, subsequently, his student, <span class="b">Aristotle</span>, were the first known individuals to have formulated the concept of The Parts of Speech. But it was <span class="b">Dionysius the Thrax</span>, an ancient Greek grammarian and scholar who lived during the 2nd century BC, who spelled out 9 of today's 10 Parts of Speech, leaving out <b>interjections</b>. He is known for his work on  grammar, specifically his treatise 
        <img class="fl" src="thrax.jpg" width="180" height="270">called <span class="b">"The Art of Grammar"</span> (τέχνη γραμματική).<p>

    This work became one of the foundational texts in the field of Greek grammar and had a significant influence on subsequent grammatical studies in both Greek and Latin; it is still regarded as the groundwork of the entire Western grammatical tradition and beyond.<p>

In "The Art of Grammar," Dionysius the Thrax described the parts of speech in Greek including <b>onomata</b> (nouns and adjectives), verbs, participles, articles, pronouns, prepositions, adverbs, and conjunctions. He also discussed topics such as syntax (sentence structure), and morphology (word formation).<p>

Dionysius the Thrax's work has had a lasting impact on the study of grammar worldwide. His classification of the Parts of Speech and his grammatical analysis methods became fundamental principles in subsequent grammatical studies and influenced the development of grammatical theories in most languages.</span><p>

    <center>&bull; &bull; &bull;</center><p>


    The Parts of Speech and their definitions are universal, which means that all languages have exactly the same Parts of Speech. However, grammarians are notoriously inaccurate and will tell you that different languages have different Parts of Speech, which is totally untrue.<p>

    What they really mean is that Parts of Speech in different languages may consist of different or more or fewer types or classes or subcategories. For example, they will tell you that English has 1 class of adjectives while Japanese has 3.<p>

    It is true that some languages, such as Russian, lack articles, but the remaining Parts of Speech are the same ones as in every other language.<p>

    But why are The Parts of Speech important?<p>

    Because each one of them defines a distinct role/function of words in clauses and, because of that, they help us study and learn languages infinitely more efficiently.<p>

    The definition of each Part of Speech spells out the role/function of each Part of Speech in a clause and those definitions are formulated on the basis of universal conceptual criteria. That means that if a word satisfies the definition of <i>verbs</i> in a given clause, then it is a verb regardless of language, puncuation, syntax, morphology, or any periphrases involved. (<b>axiom on page 4</b>)<p>


            In clauses or phrases, words as well as groups of words can be identified on two levels, <span class="b">(a)</span> Parts of Speech (PoS) analysis level  and <span class="b">(b)</span> syntactical analysis level (word order).<p>

            Let us take a look at this sentence.<p>

    The above concepts are at the core of our subject of study in this book, that is of adverb clauses. Let us then take the necessary time to shed light on the above definitions.<p>

     <center>Interpreting <span class="def">def. 22</center><p>

      We can say that, provided we have at least one subject, we have as many clauses as we have verbs:<p>

        <ul type=circle>

    <li><span class="ex">ex. 1</span> We <span class="u1">work</span><sup>1</sup> at a bank. (one clause)<p>

    <li><span class="ex">ex. 2</span> <span class="u1">Eat!</span><sup>1</sup> ([you] eat) (one clause)<p>

    <li><span class="ex">ex. 3</span> We <span class="u1">work</span><sup>1</sup> <span class="u1">and</span><sup>cj</sup> <span class="u1">study</span>.<sup>2</sup> (we work &bull; and we study) (two clauses)<p>

    <li><span class="ex">ex. 4</span> We <span class="u1">work</span><sup>1</sup>, <span class="u1">study</span>,<sup>2</sup> <span class="u1">and</span><sup>cj</sup> <span class="u1">party</span>.<sup>3</sup> 
    (we work &bull; [we] study &bull; and we party) (three clauses)<p>

    <li><span class="ex">ex. 5</span> <span class="u1">As</span><sup>cj</sup> you <span class="u1">know</span><sup>1</sup>... (as<sup>cj</sup> you know ...) (one clause)<p>

    <li><span class="ex">ex. 6</span> <span class="u1">As</span><sup>cj</sup> you <span class="u1">know</span><sup>1</sup>, it <span class="u1">has</span><sup>2</sup> been confirmed ... (as<sup>cj</sup> you know &bull; it has) (two clauses)<p>

    <li><span class="ex">ex. 7</span> <span class="u1">As</span><sup>cj</sup> you <span class="u1">know</span><sup>1</sup>, it <span class="u1">has</span><sup>2</sup> been confirmed Mrs. Jones <span class="u1">has</span><sup>3</sup> canceled her flight.<br>
    (as<sup>cj</sup> you know &bull; it has &bull; Mrs. Jones has) (three clauses)
    </ul><p>

    Lets us analyze examples 1 through 7 in more detail.<p>

    In <span class="ex">ex. 1</span>, we have <span class="b">(a)</span>a subject and <span class="b">(b)</span>a verb, which makes this specific group of words a clause. We can also see that this group of words <span class="b">(c)</span>can stand on its own. Indeed, no additional information is required for this clause to make sense.<p>

    If we observe carefully, we will notice that <span class="ex">ex. 1</span> satisfies simultaneously <span class="def">def. 22</span>, <span class="def">def. 23a</span>, <span class="def">def. 23b</span>, and <span class="def">def. 25</span>.<p>

    <span class="def">def. 23a</span> and <span class="def">def. 23b</span> are equivalent and, of course, they are absolutely <b>not</b> contradictory, because it so happens that clauses which cannot stand on their own always contain a conjunction and clauses which contain a conjunction cannot stand on their own.<p>

    To summarize, <span class="b">(a)</span><span class="ex">ex. 1</span> is a clause because it satisfies <span class="def">def. 22</span>; <span class="b">(b)</span>it is a main clause because it satisfies <span class="def">def. 23a</span> and <span class="def">def. 23b</span>; and it is <span class="b">(c)</span>a sentence because it satisfies <span class="def">def. 25</span>, since <span class="ex">ex. 1</span> is a <u>lone</u> main clause.<p>






        <p>
    
    From Socrates to Plato to Aristotle to Dionysius the Thrax to Noam Chomsky, <span class="def">def. 23a/23b</span> a <b>main clause</b> is a clause that <span class="b">(c)</span>can stand on its own (a clause can stand on its own only if it <b>does not contain</b> a conjunction).<p>

        We see that 3 requirements have to be satisfied <b>simultaneously</b> for a clause to qualify as a main one.<p>

        <span class="sen">33</span> <span class="b">Eat!</span> (imperative mood / bydemåde &bull; imperativ)<p>

        Example <span class="sen">33</span> is a main clause because it has <span class="b">(a)</span>a subject = <span class="r">you</span>, <span class="b">(b)</span>a verb = <span class="r">eat</span>, and <span class="b">(c)</span><span class="r">it can stand on its own</span>.<p>

            <span class="sen">34</span> <span class="b">Jill wakes up early every morning.</span><p>

        Example <span class="sen">34</span> is a main clause because it has <span class="b">(a)</span>a subject = <span class="r">Jill</span>, <span class="b">(b)</span> a verb = <span class="r">wakes up</span>, and <span class="b">(c)</span><span class="r">it can stand on its own</span>.<p>

            

        What is a <b>subordinate clause</b>?<p>

        <span class="def">def. 3</span> A <b>subordinate clause</b> is a clause that cannot stand on its own (a clause cannot stand on its if <b>it contains</b> a conjunction).<p>

            We see that 3 requirements have to be satisfied <b>simultaneously</b> for a clause to qualify as a subordinate one.<p>

        <span class="sen">35</span> <span class="b">And he knows the truth!</span>.<p>

        Example <span class="sen">35</span> is a subordinate clause because it has <span class="b">(a)</span>a subject = <span class="r">he</span>, <span class="b">(b)</span>a verb = <span class="r">knows</span>, and <span class="b">(c)</span><span class="r">it cannot stand on its own</span> (it is introduced by the conjunction <b>and</b>).

            <span class="sen">36</span> <span class="b">Although he dropped out of school.</span><p>

        Example <span class="sen">36</span> is a subordinate clause because it has <span class="b">(a)</span>a subject = <span class="r">he</span>, <span class="b">(b)</span>a verb = <span class="r">dropped out of</span>, and <span class="b">(c)</span><span class="r">it cannot stand on its own</span> (it is introduced by the conjunction <b>although</b>).<p>

        To summarize, all clauses must have a <b>subject</b> and a <b>verb</b>, but main clauses <b>cannot</b> contain a conjunction while subordinate clauses <b>must</b> contain a conjunction.<p>



            <center>A WORD ON DEFINITIONS &bull; EN KOMMENTER OM DEFINITIONER</center><p>

                <b>Remember</b> that definitions are not formulated just to waste paper and ink but rather to be <b>religiously</b> observed.<p>

If definitions are not observed, their very purpose is defeated and chaos ensues.<p>

Ridiculously, in the overwheling majority of grammar books that I have come across, authors repeatedly <b>ignore</b> their own definitions, which betrays their mechanical or robotic attitude towards authoring.<br>
<center><img src="page3.png" width="533" height="295"></center><br>
This is the top part of page 3 of a Danish grammar "Skriverguiden" titled "At Skrive" authored by Fanny Slotorub. It is a guide to another book by the same title and author on "Tekstsammenhæng og argumentation," ISBN 978-87-636-0418-5, published by "Praxis."<p>

These 2 books contain a plethora of errors, all because of one single but very important misunderstanding, which we are going to unravel in depth in the following paragraphs.<p> 

The books in question are written in Danish and the author defines <span class="def">def. 22</span> a <b>main clause</b> <span class="r">as a clause that can stand on its own</span>, which is correct.<p>

In the book, as you can see in the screenshot above, the following 2 clauses are cited as examples of a main clause: <span class="dan">dansk 15</span> <span class="b">(a)</span>Vi spiser. and <span class="b">(b)</span><span class="r">For</span> vi er sultne. (We eat. / <span class="r">For</span> we are hungry.), <b>for</b> here meaning <b>because</b>.<p>

Here, the author ignores her own definition since <i>For vi er sultne/For we are hungrry</i> cannot stand alone and, therefore, by definition, it does not qualify as a main clause.<p>

Actually, <i>... for vir er sultne / ... for we are hungry</i> is a subordinate clause, not just in English and Danish, but in all languages.<p>

But what exactly <i>can stand on its own</i> mean in the definition of a main clause?<p>

It means that no additional information is necessary for a clause to make sense.<p>

Let us consider these 2 dialogs:<p>

<div class="dial">
<span class="br">dialog 1</span><p>

    <span class="b">Son</span><br>&mdash; Good morning! For we are hungry.<p>
    
    <span class="b">Mother</span><br>&mdash; What!?<p>

In dialog 1, mother is confused because her son is uttering only a cause, but not an effect, so it all sounds gibberish; <i>for</i> is a <i>cause-and-effect</i> or <i>aetiological</i> conjunction and it introduces an aetiological clause. Aetiological clauses are subordinate clauses and require additional information in order for them to make sense.<p>

<center>&bull; &bull; &bull;</center><p>

</div>

            
<div class="dial">
    <span class="br">dialog 2</span>
    

    <span class="b">Son</span><br>
    &mdash; Good morning! We are hungry.<p>

    <span class="b">Mother</span><br>
    &mdash; Well, make some breakfast.
</div><p>

It is obvious that <i>For we are hungry</i> cannot stand alone and therefore it is a subordinate clause. Period!<p>

So, what is going on?<p>

Let me explain.<p>

In Danish, the syntax of main clauses happens to be <b>S</b>ubject + <b>V</b>erb + <b>A</b>dverb or SVA.<p>
For instance, <span class="sen">31</span> <span class="b"><span class="u1">Vi</span><sup>S</sup> <span class="u1">arbejder</span><sup>V</sup> <span class="u1">hårdt.</span><sup>A</sup> / 
<span class="u1">We</span><sup>S</sup> <span class="u1">work</span><sup>V</sup> <span class="u1">hard.</span><sup>A</sup></span><p>

Now, the syntax of clauses introduced by <b>for</b> also happens to be SVA, that is the same syntax as that of main clauses.<p>

For instance, <span class="sen">32</span> <span class="b">For <span class="u1">vejret</span><sup>S</sup> <span class="u1">er</span><sup>V</sup> <span class="u1">også</span><sup>A</sup> dårligt. / For 
<span class="u1">the weather</span><sup>S</sup> <span class="u1">is</span><sup>V</sup> <span class="u1">also</span><sup>A</sup> bad.</span><p>

Voilà! The incredibly superficial logic emerges! It goes like this:<p>

Since the syntax of the clauses introduced by <b>for</b> is the same as the syntax of main clauses, it follows that clauses introduced by <b>for</b> are also main clauses.<p>

Never mind that clause <span class="sen">32</span> cannot stand alone, which is <b>the opposite</b> of the very definition of main clauses the author herself cites on page 3 in her own book. That is all forgotten now, which betrays the mechanical or robotic mindset of most authors.

The author's logic would be OK if the definition of main clauses were <i><b>Main clauses</b> are clauses whose syntax is SVA</i>, which, of course, is not the definition of main clauses.<p>

To correct the contradiction, <i>hovedsætningskonjuktioner / main-clause conjunctions</i> should be renamed <i>SVA conjunctions</i>. The rule, then, would be:<p>

The syntax of all subordinate clauses introduced by <span class="b">og, men, eller, for, så</span> is SVA.<p>

We'll be examining all this in depth, as a thorough analysis of main and subordinate clauses follows...
