  <b>Nadine, Ali y Imran on different aspects of Danish culture</b></center><p>

    <b>Nadine: Comfort and agreement</b><p>

I have noticed that "fun" is an important thing for the Danes. You enjoy yourself when you can relax and "be yourself." Enjoying oneself is often something we experience with friends, candles and some good food and drink — and the Danes are good at enjoying themselves.<p>


<i>Hygge</i> is best when you agree. Discussion and disagreement can easily spoil the fun and the Danes will often go to great lengths to maintain the good mood. They are therefore often quick to 'smooth things out.' I actually think they can be a little conflict shy.<p>


<b>Ali: Jantelov</b><p>

I think that the Danes care a lot about everyone being equal. And equality is of course very good, but here it also often means that you must not 'stand out from the crowd.'<p>


If you are good at something, you must "go quietly with it." People have little respect either for titles or authority. No one should think they are better than others. This is where the "Janteloven" comes into play.<p>


It's a bit of a shame, I think, because it also keeps people down. The Danes don't seem very ambitious either. In my home country people look up to those who "stand out" and do well.<p>


<b>Imran: "I-culture" and "we-culture"</b><p>

I think that people have a lot of personal freedom here in Denmark. Here the individual is the most important thing — then comes the family or group. Everyone can do whatever they want, and you also have great respect for the personal freedom of others.<p>


But then the family bond is not that strong either. The young leave home early to live their own lives, and the old fend off for themselves or the municipality takes care of them.<p>


It's not like that in my home country. Here the family or group comes first, not the individual. Here everyone must bow to the community and follow the group's norms. But then we also stick together and help each other.<p>
