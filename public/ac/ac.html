            <center>A WORD ON CONCEPTS &bull; EN KOMMENTER OM BEGREBER</center><p>

    Literally <b>everything</b> that exists, be it animate or inanimate, is, among other things, a concept. Definitions describe concepts. All concepts have a representation, be it physical, visual, literal, or conceptual.<p>

    For instance, an <span class="b">apple</span>, a concrete noun, can be represented in 4 objective ways:

<div>
    <ol>
        <li><b>physical (real apples)</b> <span style="position:relative; top:15px; border-radius:10%;"><img src="aaa.png" width="40" height="40" style="vertical-align: bottom"></span><p>
        <li><b>visual (on a screen or in a photo or in a painting):</b> <span style="position:relative; top:10px; border-radius:10%;"><img src="aaa.avif" width="62" height="42" style="vertical-align: bottom"></span><p>
        <li><b>literal (the word):</b> apple<p>
        <li><b>conceptual (definition):</b> <b>An apple</b> is typically round or oblong fruit with smooth or slightly textured skin. The skin color can vary depending on the variety and can be shades of red, green, yellow, or a combination thereof. Apples have a firm and juicy flesh and their taste can range from sweet to tart.
    </ol>
</div><p>

    But <span class="b">kindness</span>, an abstract noun,  can be represented only in 2 objective ways:<p>

        <ol start=5>
        <li><b>literal (the word):</b> kindness<p>
        <li><b>conceptual (definition):</b> <b>Kindness</b> is a positive quality or characteristic demonstrated through compassionate and considerate behavior towards others.
    </ol><p>

    The thing to understand here is that <span class="b">(a)</span>since represenations of concepts are <b>something</b> and <span class="b">(b)</span>since <b>everything</b> is, among other things, a concept, <span class="b">(c)</span>it follows that representations of concepts are also concepts.<p>

    We can therefore refer to <i>the concept of the physical representation of an apple</i> or the <i>concept of the literal representation of an apple</i> and so on.<p>

    Some concepts are universal while others are not. For example, literal representations, that is words, are not universal, while conceptual represenations are universal. Indeed, the literal representation of an <span style="position:relative; top:10px; border-radius:10%;"><img src="aaa.avif" width="62" height="42" style="vertical-align: bottom"></span> in English is <span class="b">apple</span>, while in Danish is <span class="b">æble</span>; however, conceptual representations are universal.<p>


        <center>A WORD ON LANGUAGE &bull; EN KOMMENTER OM SPROG</center><p>


A language can be broken down into <span class="b">(a)</span>vocabulary (words), <span class="b">(b)</span>phonetics (pronunciation) rules, <span class="b">(c)</span>punctuation rules, <span class="b">(d)</span>syntax (word order) rules, and <span class="b">(e)</span>morphology rules, part of which are periphrases.<p>

<span class="b">(f)</span>There are far more concepts than words and <span class="b">(g)</span>each word represents only one concept at a time and <span class="b">(h)</span>each concept has a definition and <span class="b">(i)</span>there is only one valid definition for each concept and <span class="b">(j)</span>there is not a single word which represents only one concept.<br><span style="font-size:9pt;">(Isidoros Parlamas &bull; Applied Dialectics & Horistics)</span><p>

    Let me elaborate on the statement above:<p>

    <span class="b">(f)</span><i>There are far more concepts than words</i><p>
    For every word and in every language there are at least 2 concepts associated with it. As an example, let us think of <b>water</b>. How many concepts does <b>water</b> represent? Well, let's see how many of them we can think of off hand.<p>

            <div class="pagebreak"> </div>
            <div class="p"><b>page 2</b></div><p>
    <ol start=7>
        <li>I drink 2 liters of <b>water</b> every day. (H<sub style="font-size:8pt;">2</sub>O &rarr; uncountable noun)<p>
            <span class="k">Jeg drikker 2 liter vand hver dag.</span><p>
        <li>My eyes <b>water</b> when I see homeless children. (intransitive verb)<br>
            <span class="k">Mine øjne løber i vand, når jeg ser hjemløse børn.</span><p>
        <li>My mouth <b>waters</b> when I smell fresh fish. (intransitive verb)<br>
            <span class="k">Min mund løber i vand, når jeg lugter frisk fisk.</span><p>
        <li>I <b>water</b> my garden  once a week. (transitive verb)<br>
            <span class="k">Jeg vander min have en gang om ugen.</span>
    </ol>

    We see that <b>water</b> represents at least 4 different concepts.<p>

    <span class="b">(g)</span><i>Each word represents only one concept at a time</i><p>
    But even though <b>water</b> represents various concepts, it represents <u>only one concept at a time</u>. As you can see, in each of the 4 sentences above, <b>water</b> represents only one concept. For example, in sentence 1, it represents only H<sub style="font-size:8pt;">2</sub>O.<p>

    <span class="b">(h)</span><i>each concept has a definition</i><p>
        The definition of <b>water</b> in sentence 1 above is its chemical formula: <span class="b">H<sub style="font-size:8pt;">2</sub>O.</span><p>
        The definition of <b>water</b> in sentence 2 above is <span class="b">overflowing of the eyes with tears.</span><p>
        The definition of <b>water</b> in sentence 3 above is <span class="b">the production of an abnormally large amount of saliva in the mouth.</span><p>
        The definition of <b>water</b> in sentence 4 above is <span class="b">providing moisture to plants and/or trees by applying water to the soil.</span><p>


        <span class="b">(i)</span><i>there is only one valid definition for each concept</i><p>


    Of course, anyone can attempt to define a concept. If, for example, we ask 10 people to define <b>justice</b>, we will most probably end up with 10 different definitions, of which, most probably, none will be apposite.<p>

    <b>Justice</b>, just like all other words, represents more than one concept, but each specific concept of <b>justice</b> has only one valid definition.<p>

    It takes a lot of training in <i>Dialectics</i> and <i>Horistics</i> to be able to come up with valid definitions. <b>Horistics</b> is the art/skill of defining.<p>

    <span class="b">(j)</span><i>there is not a single word which represents only one concept</i><p>
    This may sound impossible, but it is true. Even words such as <b>and</b> represent more than one concept. Let us take a look.<p>

    <ol start=11>
        <li>Two <b>and</b> three equals five. (cummulative &bull; <b>and</b> here conveys the concept of increase)<p>
        <li>George invited Helen to dinner, <b>and</b> he didn't pay for it. (contrast &bull; <b>and</b> here means <b>but</b>)<p>
        <li>Jill was anxious about her date, <b>and</b> she canceled it. (effect &bull; <b>and</b> here means <b>so</b>)
    </ol><p>

        You get the idea...<p>


<center>PARTS OF SPEECH &bull; DELE AF TALE</center><p>

            <span style="text-align:justify;"><span class="b">
    Important <b>axiom</b>: Parts of Speech are concepts. There are 10 Parts of Speech and each word belongs in one of them. Parts of Speech are <b>language independent</b>, meaning that they are <i><span class="r">(a)</span>vocabulary independent, <span class="r">(b)</span>punctuation independent, <span class="r">(c)</span>syntax independent, <i><span class="r">(d)</span>morphology<span style="color:black;">*</span> independent</i>, and <span class="r">(e)</span>periphrasis<span style="color:black;">**</span> independent</i>. A verb, then, remains a verb in all languages regardless of the vocabulary or punctuationor syntax or morphology or periphrasis involved. You really &nbsp; need to understand that while <b>vocabulary, syntax,

            <div class="pagebreak"> </div>
            <div class="p"><b>page 3</b></div><p>

    <span style="text-align:justify;"><span class="b">punctuation</b>, <span class="b"><b>morphology</b>, and <span class="r">(d)</span><b>periphrasis</b> are language dependent, <span class="r">concepts, and by extension, Parts of Speech, are not</span>. That is to say that Parts of Speech are universal</span></span></span>.<p>

            

        For instance, <b>working hard</b> is a concept. <b>They work hard</b> is said in all countries, irrespective of vocabulary, punctuation, word order, morphology or periphrases. So, on planet Earth, in this specific example, <b>they</b> will always be a subject pronoun, <b>work</b> will always be a verb, and <b>hard</b> will always be an adverb.<p>

        Let us see this same sentence in a few different languages:<p>

            <ol start=14>
                <li><b>English:</b><span class="fu"><b>They</b></span> <span class="b">work</span> <span class="r">hard</span>.<p>

                <li><b>Danish:</b> <span class="fu"><b>De</b></span> <span class="b">arbejder</span> <span class="r">hårdt</span>.<p>

                <li><b>Modern Greek:</b> <span class="fu"><b>Αυτοί</b></span> <span class="b">εργάζονται</span> <span class="r">σκληρά</span>.<p>

                <li><b>Spanish:</b> <span class="fu"><b>Ellos</b></span> <span class="b">trabajan</span> <span class="r">duro</span>.<p>

                <li><b>Polish:</b> <span class="fu"><b>Oni</b></span> <span class="b">pracują</span> <span class="r">ciężko</span>.<p>

                <li><b>Russian:</b> <span class="fu"><b>Они</b></span> <span class="r">много</span> <span class="b">работают</span>. (The syntax is different here, but Parts of Speech remain unaffected.)<p>

                <li><b>Mandarin Chinese:</b> <span class="fu"><b>他们</b></span> <span class="b">工作</span> <span class="r">努力</span>。<p>

            </ol><p>

            We can see that in every single language above the <span class="fu"><b>fuchsia</b></span> is <u>the subject pronoun</u>, the <span class="b"><b>blue</b></span> is <u>the verb</u> and the <span class="r"><b>red</b></span> is <u>the adverb</u>, which demonstrates neatly that Parts of Speech are universal.<p>

    Parts of Speech are, then, strictly <b>function dependent</b>, which means that each Part of Speech plays a distinct nonvariable role in the clause; in other words, the role of verbs is invariably the same, the role of nouns is invariably the same, and so on. The role that each Part of Speech has in clauses is spelled out in its own definition, meaning the definition of each Part of Speech is really the description of its role in the clause.
    <hr>

    *<b>morphology</b> refers to internal structure and formation of words in a language, which involves, among other things, prefixes, suffixes, inflection, declension, conjugation, and periphrases. In English, we decline nouns, adjectives, and pronouns and we conjugate verbs. For instance, the subject of verbs in English is indicated by nouns or subject pronouns: <i><b>Helen</b> works</i> or <i><b>she</b> works</i>, but in Spanish, it is indicated by the different endings of the verb as the verb is conjugated: <i>Helena trabaj<b>a</b></i> or <i>trabaj<b>a</b></i> or <i>ella trabaj<b>a</b></i>; <i>Helena y Juan trabaj<b>an</b></i> or <i>ellos trabaj<b>an</b></i>.<p>

    **<b>perifrasis</b>, plural <b>periphrases</b>, is part of morphology and refers to polylexical (multi-worded) forms of Parts of Speech. For example, <i>to be fond of</i> is a periphrasis of <i>to like</i>, but they are both verbs and their meaning is roughly the same. <i>Even though</i> is a periphrasis of <i>although</i>, but they are both conjunctions and their meaning is roughly the same. Periphrases do not always occur in pairs. For example, <i>look forward to</i> does not have a monolexical (single-worded) counterpart.<p>


        These are the 10 Parts of Speech in alphabetical order:

        <ol type=A>
            <li>adjectives (<span class="r">good</span> food)<p>

            <li>adverbs (<span class="r">well</span> done)<p>

            <li>articles (<span class="r">the</span> right choice)<p>

            <li>conjunctions (He's in Europe, <span class="r">but</span> I'm in Africa.)<p>

            <li>interjections (<span class="r">Wow!</span> Do you mean that?)<p>

            <li>nouns (high <span class="r">quality</span>)<p>

            <li>participles (an <span class="r">extended</span> period of time &bull; an <span class="r">interesting</span> book)<p>

            <li>prepositions (<span class="r">at</span> home)<p>

            <li>pronouns (It's <span class="r">them</span>!)<p>

            <li>verbs (We <span class="r">meet</span> often.)<p>
        </ol>

                <div class="pagebreak"> </div>
                <div class="p"><b>page 4</b></div><p>

        There are also a handful of words, usually less than 10, called <b>particles</b>, which do not fit into any of the definitions of the Parts of Speech. For example, in English, the word <b>to</b>, when part of the infinitive, is sometimes, but not always, a <b>particle</b>.<p>

    Mostly directly, but also indirectly, Parts of Speech are noun-centered, that is nouns are the sun of the solar system of the Parts of Speech. All other 9 Parts of Speech revolve around nouns.<p>
    <ol type=A start=11>
        <li>Nouns are names.<p>
            <i>George, Helen, apple, kindness, cruelty, man, horse, tree, gravity</i> are all nouns.<p>
        <li>Articles qualify nouns in terms of gender, person, number et al. Some languages lack articles.<p>
            <i>the, a/an, of</i> are all articles.<p>
        <li>Adjectives are words that qualify <b>nouns</b>.<p>
            <i>good, bad, heavy, important, ridiculous, this, these</i> are all adjectives.</ol>

        <ol start=14 type=A>
        <li>Participles derive from verbs and, just like adjectives, they qualify <b>nouns</b>.

            <i>interesting, concerned, complicated, living, </i> are all participles.<p>
        <li>Pronouns replace <b>nouns</b>.<p>
            <i>he, she, it, them, herself, this, those</i> are all pronouns.<p>
        <li>Verbs denote an action, occurrence, or state of being, in which protagonsists are <b>nouns</b> or <b>pronouns</b>.<p>
            <i>go, put, write, sleep, be, think, work, give</i> are all verbs.<p>
        <li>Prepositions answer questions about <b>nouns</b> by qualifying <i>time, place, manner, degree, quantity, quality et al.</i><p>
            <i>at, in, around, on, under</i> are all prepositions.<p>
        <li>Adverbs qualify <span class="r">(a)</span>verbs, <span class="r">(b)</span>adjectives, and <span class="r">(c)</span>other adverbs.<p>
            <i>well, fortunately, sadly, fast, hard</i> are all adverbs.<p>
        <li>Conjunctions connect clauses while, at the same time, they establish fundamental relationships between them.<p>
            <i>and, or, therefore, for, while, before</i> are all conjunctions.<p>
        <li>Interjections  are standalone words or phrases which express strong emotions, sudden reactions, or short exclamations.<p>
            <i>Wow! Ouch! Oh no! Yay! Oops! Ah... Ugh!</i> are all interjections.
    </ol><p>

        The same word can be more than one Part of Speech depending on its function in the clause or phrase. This phenomenon is language dependent.<p>

        <ol start=22>
            <li>Some nouns can also be adjectives.<p>
                This <b>animal</b> is beautiful. (noun)<br>
                <b>Animal</b> feed can be expensive. (adjective)<p>

            <li>Some adjectives can also be nouns or adverbs.<p>
                This is a <b>good</b> job. (adjective)<br>
                I am thinking of the greater <b>good</b>. (noun)<br>
                She runs <b>fast</b>. (adverb)<p>

            <li>Some present/active participles can also be nouns.<p>
                The children are <b>swimming</b>. (present/active participle)<br>

                <div class="pagebreak"> </div>
                <div class="p"><b>page 5</b></div><p>

                <b>Swimmimg</b> is a great sport. (noun/gerund)<p>

            <li>Some past participles can also be adjectives.<p>
                This issue has always <b>complicated</b> things. (past participle)<br>
                This is a <b>complicated</b> situation. (adjective)<p>

            <li>Some pronouns can also be adjectives.<p>

                <b>This</b> is beautiful. (demonstrative pronoun)<br>
                <b>This</b> flower is beautiful. (demonstrative adjective)<p>

            <li>Some verbs can also be nouns.<p>

                I <b>sleep</b> well. (verb)<br>
                Adequate <b>sleep</b> is crucial for overall health. (noun)<p>

            <li>Some prepositions can also be conjunctions or adverbs.<p>

                He is standing <b>before</b> her. (preposition)<br>
                He had called <b>before</b> she arrived. (conjunction)<br>

                She has done that <b>before</b>. (adverb)<p>

            <li>Some adverbs can also be adjectives.<p>

                We work <b>hard</b>. (adverb)<br>
                The soil is very <b>hard</b>. (adjective)<p>

            <li>Some conjunctions can also be prepositions.<p>

                She stayed home <b>for</b>, as she said, she was feeling unwell. (conjunction)<br>
                I am doing this <b>for</b> you. (preposition)

    <center>A LITTLE HISTORY</center><p>

        <span class="b">Plato</span>, in Plato's Cratylus, and, subsequently, his student, <span class="b">Aristotle</span>, were the first known individuals to have formulated the concept of The Parts of Speech. But it was <span class="b">Dionysius the Thrax</span>, an ancient Greek grammarian and scholar who lived during the 2nd century BC, who spelled out 9 of today's 10 Parts of Speech, leaving out <b>intejections</b>. He is known for his work on  grammar, specifically his treatise 
        <img class="fl" src="thrax.jpg">called <span class="b">"The Art of Grammar."</span> (τέχνη γραμματική)<p>

    This work became one of the foundational texts in the field of Greek grammar and had a significant influence on subsequent grammatical studies in both Greek and Latin, and it is still regarded as the groundwork of the entire Western grammatical tradition and beyond.<p>

In "The Art of Grammar," Dionysius the Thrax described the parts of speech in Greek including <b>onomata</b> (nouns and adjectives), verbs, participles, articles, pronouns, prepositions, adverbs, and conjunctions. He also discussed topics such as syntax (sentence structure), and morphology (word formation).<p>

Dionysius the Thrax's work has had a lasting impact on the study of grammar worldwide. His classification of the Parts of Speech and his grammatical analysis methods became fundamental principles in subsequent grammatical studies and influenced the development of grammatical theories in most languages.</span><p>


    The Parts of Speech and their definitions are universal, which means that all languages have exactly the same Parts of Speech. However, grammarians are notoriously inaccurate and will tell you that different languages have different Parts of Speech, which is totally untrue.<p>

    What they really mean is that Parts of Speech in different languages may consist of different or more or fewer types or classes or subcategories. For example, they will tell you that &nbsp; English has 1 class of &nbsp;adjectives while

Japanese has 3.<p>

    It is true that some languages, such as Russian, lack articles, but the remaining Parts of Speech are the same ones as in every other language.<p>

    But why are The Parts of Speech important?<p>

    Because each one of them defines a distinct role/function of words in clauses and, because of that, they help us study and learn languages infinitely more efficiently.<p>

    The definition of each Part of Speech spells out the role/function of each Part of Speech in a clause and those definitions are formulated on the basis of universal conceptual criteria. That means that if a word satisfies the definition of <i>verbs</i> in a given clause, then it is a verb regardless of language, puncuation, syntax, periphrasis, or morphology. (<b>axiom on page 2</b>)<p>


            In clauses or phrases*, words as well as groups of words can be identified on two levels, <span class="b">(a)</span> the lexical level (as a part of speach) and <span class="b">(b)</span> syntactical level (word order).<p>

            Let us take a look at this sentence:<p>


                <span class="b">Both of them work hard.</span>

                Parts of Speech or Lexical Analysis:<p>

                <ul>
                    <li>both (<span class="b">pronoun / stedord</span>)<p>
                    <li>of (<span class="b">partitive article / delingsartikel</span>)<p>
                    <li>them (<span class="b">pronoun / stedord</span>)<p>
                    <li>work (<span class="b">verb / udsagnsord</span>)<p>
                    <li>hard (<span class="b">adverb / biord</span>)<p>
                </ul><p>

                Syntactical Analysis:<p>

                <ul>
                    <li>both of them (<span class="b">subject / subjekt</span>)<p>
                    <li>work hard (<span class="b">predicate / udsagnsled</span>)
                </ul><p>

                * A <b>phrase</b> is a word or a group of words that conveys a meaning but does not have the subject-verb unit.<p>

                For example:<p>

            <ul>
                <li>Good!<p>
                <li>Weather permitting.<p>
                <li>Once upon a time.<p>
                <li>God willing!<p>
                <li>Damn it!
            </ul><p>

                are all phrases.

            <center>A WORD ON DEFINITIONS &bull; EN KOMMENTER OM DEFINITIONER</center><p>

                <b>Remember</b> that definitions are not formulated just to waste paper and ink but rather to be <b>religiously</b> observed.<p>

If definitions are not observed, their very purpose is defeated and chaos ensues.<p>

Ridiculously, in the overwheling majority of grammar books that I have come across, authors repeatedly <b>ignore</b> their own definitions, which betrays their mechanical or robotic attitude towards authoring.<br>
<center><img src="page3.png" width="533" height="295"></center><br>
This is the top part of page 3 of a Danish grammar "Skriverguiden" titled "At Skrive" authored by Fanny Slotorub. It is a guide to another book by the same title and author on "Tekstsammenhæng og argumentation," ISBN 978-87-636-0418-5, published by "Praxis."<p>

It is written in Danish and the author defines a <b>main clause</b> <span class="br">as a clause that can stand on its own</span>, which is the correct definition of a main clause, citing as examples 2 clauses: Vi spiser. / <span class="r">For</span> vi er sultne. (We eat. / <span class="r">For</span> we are hungry.), <b>for</b> here meaning <b>because</b>.<p>

Here, the author ignores her own definition since <i>For vi er sultne/For we are hungrry</i> cannot stand alone and, therefore, by definition, it does not qualify for a main clause.<p>

Actually, <i>... for vir er sultne / ... for we are hungry</i> is a subordinate clause, not just in English and Danish, but in all languages.<p>

But what exactly <i>can stand on its own</i> mean in the definition of main clauses?<p>

It means that no additional information is necessary for a clause to make sense.<p>

Let us consider these 2 dialogs:<p>

<div class="sen">
dialog 1<p>
    &mdash; Good morning! For we are hungry.<p>
    &mdash; What!?<p>
dialog 2</div>

            <div class="pagebreak"> </div>
            <div class="p"><b>page 8</b></div><p>
<div class="sen">
    &mdash; Good morning! We are hungry.<p>
    &mdash; Well, make some breakfast.
</div><p>

It is obvious that <i>For we are hungry</i> cannot stand alone and therefore it is a subordinate clause. Period!<p>

So, what is going on?<p>

Let me explain.<p>

In Danish, the syntax of main clauses happens to be <b>S</b>ubject + <b>V</b>erb + <b>A</b>dverb or SVA.<p>
For instance, <span class="sen">31</span> <span class="b"><span class="u1">Vi</span><sup>S</sup> <span class="u1">arbejder</span><sup>V</sup> <span class="u1">hårdt.</span><sup>A</sup> / 
<span class="u1">We</span><sup>S</sup> <span class="u1">work</span><sup>V</sup> <span class="u1">hard.</span><sup>A</sup></span><p>

Now, the syntax of clauses introduced by <b>for</b> also happens to be SVA, that is the same syntax as that of main clauses.<p>

For instance, <span class="sen">32</span> <span class="b">For <span class="u1">vejret</span><sup>S</sup> <span class="u1">er</span><sup>V</sup> <span class="u1">også</span><sup>A</sup> dårligt. / For 
<span class="u1">the weather</span><sup>S</sup> <span class="u1">is</span><sup>V</sup> <span class="u1">also</span><sup>A</sup> bad.</span><p>

Voilà! The incredibly superficial logic emerges! It goes like this:<p>

Since the syntax of the clauses introduced by <b>for</b> is the same as the syntax of main clauses, it follows that clauses introduced by <b>for</b> are also main clauses.<p>

Never mind that clause <span class="sen">32</span> cannot stand alone, which is <b>the opposite</b> of the very definition of main clauses the author herself cites on page 3 in her own book. That is all forgotten now, which betrays the mechanical or robotic mindset of most authors.

The author's logic would be OK if the definition of main clauses were <i><b>Main clauses</b> are clauses whose syntax is SVA</i>, which, of course, is not the definition of main clauses.<p>

To correct the contradiction, <i>hovedsætningskonjuktioner / main-clause conjunctions</i> should be renamed <i>SVA conjunctions</i>. The rule, then, would be:<p>

The syntax of all subordinate clauses introduced by <span class="b">og, men, eller, for, så</span> is SVA.<p>

We'll be examining all this in depth, as a thorough analysis of main and subordinate clauses follows...

    What is a <b>clause</b>? What is a <b>main/independent clause</b>? What is a <b>subordinate/dependent clause</b>?<p>

    First, what is a <b>clause</b>?<p>

    <span class="def">def. 1</span> A <b>clause</b> is a word or group of words that <span class="b">(a)</span>has a subject and a <span class="b">(b)</span>a verb.<p>

    What is a <b>main clause</b>?<p>

    From Plato to Aristotle to Dionysius the Thrax to Noam Chomsky, <span class="def">def. 2</span> a <b>main clause</b> is a clause that <span class="b">(c)</span>can stand on its own (a clause can stand on its own only if it <b>does not contain</b> a conjunction).<p>

        We see that 3 requirements have to be satisfied <b>simultaneously</b> for a clause to qualify as a main one.<p>

        <span class="sen">33</span> <span class="b">Eat!</span> (imperative mood / bydemåde &bull; imperativ)<p>

        Example <span class="sen">33</span> is a main clause because it has <span class="b">(a)</span>a subject = <span class="r">you</span>, <span class="b">(b)</span>a verb = <span class="r">eat</span>, and <span class="b">(c)</span><span class="r">it can stand on its own</span>.<p>

            <span class="sen">34</span> <span class="b">Jill wakes up early every morning.</span><p>

        Example <span class="sen">34</span> is a main clause because it has <span class="b">(a)</span>a subject = <span class="r">Jill</span>, <span class="b">(b)</span> a verb = <span class="r">wakes up</span>, and <span class="b">(c)</span><span class="r">it can stand on its own</span>.<p>

            <div class="pagebreak"> </div>
            <div class="p"><b>page 9</b></div><p>

        What is a <b>subordinate clause</b>?<p>

        <span class="def">def. 3</span> A <b>subordinate clause</b> is a clause that cannot stand on its own (a clause cannot stand on its if <b>it contains</b> a conjunction).<p>

            We see that 3 requirements have to be satisfied <b>simultaneously</b> for a clause to qualify as a subordinate one.<p>

        <span class="sen">35</span> <span class="b">And he knows the truth!</span>.<p>

        Example <span class="sen">35</span> is a subordinate clause because it has <span class="b">(a)</span>a subject = <span class="r">he</span>, <span class="b">(b)</span>a verb = <span class="r">knows</span>, and <span class="b">(c)</span><span class="r">it cannot stand on its own</span> (it is introduced by the conjunction <b>and</b>).

            <span class="sen">36</span> <span class="b">Although he dropped out of school.</span><p>

        Example <span class="sen">36</span> is a subordinate clause because it has <span class="b">(a)</span>a subject = <span class="r">he</span>, <span class="b">(b)</span>a verb = <span class="r">dropped out of</span>, and <span class="b">(c)</span><span class="r">it cannot stand on its own</span> (it is introduced by the conjunction <b>although</b>).<p>

        To summarize, all clauses must have a <b>subject</b> and a <b>verb</b>, but main clauses <b>cannot</b> contain a conjunction while subordinate clauses <b>must</b> contain a conjunction.<p>
