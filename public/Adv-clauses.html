	<center>ADVERBIAL CLAUSES</center><hr>

<ol>
<li>Adverbial clauses of manner<p>
An adverbial clause of manner describes how the action described in the sentence’s main clause is taking place or previously took place. Here are a few examples:<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>She addressed the crowd <b>as she had practiced in the mirror.</b> (how)<p>
<li>They designed the new product <b>the way innovators solve problems around design flaws.</b> (how)
</ol><p>

<li>Adverbial clauses of place<p>

Adverbial clauses of place describe where the action in a sentence’s main clause takes place. See how they work in these examples:<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>My son told me another fight broke out <b>where he eats lunch at school.</b> (where)<p>
<li>They drove <b>beyond where the city ends.</b> (where)
</ol><p>

<li>Adverbial clauses of condition<p>
With an adverbial clause of condition, you can communicate the conditions related to the verb, adverb, or adjective in the sentence’s main clause.<p>
These examples demonstrate a few ways to use adverbial clauses of condition:<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>We’ll be sitting in the conference room <b>until they tell us to leave.</b> (time condition)<p>
<li><b>Whether my husband likes it or not,</b> we’ll be celebrating Thanksgiving at my parents’ house. (place condition)
</ol><p>

<li>Adverbial clauses of reason<p>
Adverbial clauses of reason tell us the reason for the action being taken in the sentence’s main clause. These clauses generally use subordinating conjunctions like because, unless, and since.<p>
Here are a few examples of sentences that include adverbial clauses of reason:<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>We adopted these two cats <b>because they are a bonded pair.</b> (why)<p>
<li>He’s amazing at billiards <b>since he spent his youth working in a pool hall.</b> (why)
</ol><p>

<li>Adverbial clauses of time<p>
Adverbial clauses of time communicate when the action in a sentence takes place:<p>

<ol type=a>
<li><b>Before she got home,</b> she called and ordered a pizza. (when)<p>
<li>They assembled, dressed, and marched out <b>as the band played.</b> (when)
</ol><p>

<li>Adverbial clauses of purpose<p>
Like adverbial clauses of reason, adverbial clauses of purpose frequently involve subordinating conjunctions. These two kinds of clauses can look similar, but they have one key difference: While adverbial clauses of reason give the reason why something is happening, adverbial clauses of purpose explain the reason to take a specific action.<p>
Here are a few examples:

<ol type=a>
<li>We studied all night <b>so we would pass the exam.</b> (purpose)<p>
<li><b>So that they could ease the traffic flow,</b> the event organizers split the group into three cohorts. (purpose)
</ol><p>

<li>Adverbial clauses of comparison<p>
Adverbial clauses of comparison are clauses that communicate how the subject of the dependent clause compares to the subject in the main clause.<p>

There are two types of adverbial clauses of comparison: adverbial clauses of comparison of degree and adverbial clauses of comparison of manner.<p>

Here are a few examples of adverbial clauses of comparison of <b>degree:</b><p>

<ol type=a>
<li>Felix is as good at video games <b>as he is good at weight lifting.</b> (equally)<p>
<li>We expected the afternoon class to perform better on the test <b>than the morning class did.</b> (better)
</ol><p>

Here are a few examples of adverbial clauses of comparison of <b>manner:</b><p>

<ol type=a start=3>
<li>The events unfolded <b>as the oracle prophesized.</b> (in the same way)<p>
<li>My wedding vows went as well <b>as I’d hoped.</b> (both clauses are dependent)
</ol><p>

<li>Adverbial clause of concession<p>
In an adverbial clause of concession, the writer acknowledges or admits a factor that modifies the main clause.<p>
Take a look at these adverbial clauses of concession:<p>

<ol type=a>
<li><b>Despite the fact that I had good intentions,</b> the interaction went horribly wrong. (contrary)<p>
<li>The department head hired the first person they interviewed, <b>though twenty people applied for the job.</b> (paradox)
</ol>
</ol><hr>


Examples of adverbial clauses<p>
Previously, we demonstrated how adverbial clauses can appear at the beginning or at the end of a sentence. They can also appear in the middle, as they do in these examples:<p>

<ol start=9>
<li>Our team, <b>whenever they win a match,</b> acts like a swarm of bees and comes together as a cohesive unit.<p>

<li>Jill sat, <b>because hes usual spot at the table was taken,</b> in a chair in the corner.
</ol><p>

Adverbial clauses can be long, sometimes even longer than their sentences’ main clauses:<p>

<ol start=11>
<li><b>Because there was ice on the road and I’d already slipped and fallen twice in the last week,</b> I stayed home from school.<p>
<li>My sister, <b>although she showed more patience than I’ve ever seen her have before,</b> still rushed ahead.<p>
</ol><p>

They can also be quite short:<p>

<ol start=13>
<li>I took out the trash <b>because it stunk.</b><p>

<li>It was dark in the hallway, <b>so Marta illuminated it after she found a book of matches in her backpack.</b>
</ol><hr>

<ol>
<li>Main/Base Verb<p>
	The <b>base</b> verb is the form of a verb where it has no ending (-ing, -ed, -en) added to it. It is also called the Root Verb since it is the very root form of a verb.<p>
		<ol type=a>
			<li>I <b>go</b> to school every day.
			<li>You <b>run</b> a mile every morning.
			<li><b>Do</b> your homework.
		</ol><p>

<li>Regular/Weak Verb
<li>Irregular/Strong Verb
<li>Transitive Verb
<li>Intransitive Verb
<li>Weak Verb
<li>Strong Verb
<li>Finite Verbs
<li>Non-finite Verbs
<li>Action Verbs
<li>Linking/Intensive Verb<p>

	A linking verb adds details about the subject of a sentence. In its simplest form, it connects the subject and the complement — that is, the words that follow the linking verb. It creates a link between them instead of showing action.<p>

Often, what is on each side of a linking verb is equivalent; the complement redefines or restates the subject.<p>

Generally, linking verbs are called "be" verbs which are <b>am, is, are, was, were,</b> have/has/had + <b>been.</b> However, there are some other verbs that can work as linking verbs. Those verbs are:<p>

<b>Act, feel, remain, appear, become, seem, smell, sound, grow, look, prove, stay, taste, turn.</b><p>

Some verbs in this list can also be action verbs. To figure out if they are linking verbs, you should try replacing them with forms of the be verbs. If the changed sentence makes sense, that verb is a linking verb.<p>

	<ol type=a>
		<li>She appears ready for the game. (She is ready for the game.)
		<li>The food seemed delicious. (The food was delicious.)
		<li>You look happy. (You are happy.)
	</ol><p>

<li>Auxiliary Verbs
<li>Modal Verbs
<li>Reflexive Verb
<li>Ergative Verb
<li>Phrasal Verb
<li>Lexical Verb
<li>Delexical Verb<p>
	<b>Delexical</b> Verbs lack importance when it comes to meaning since these Verbs hardly have meanings of their own when used individually. The meaning is taken out of the Verbs and put into the Noun. Take, have, make, give etc. are Delexical Verbs.<p>
		<ol type=a>
			<li>He <b>took</b> a shower.
			<li>I <b>had</b> a cold drink.
			<li>She <b>made</b> some arrangements.
		</ol><p>

<li>Stative/Being Verb
<li>Dynamic Verb
<li>Non-continuous Verb
<li>Intensive/Linking Verb<p>
	The Verbs that focus intensely on just the Subject are called Intensive Verbs. Intensive Verbs are also called Linking or Copular Verbs.<p>
	<ol type=a>
		<li>You seem happy.
		<li>It appears to be just perfect.
		<li>She looks stunning.
		<li>He's become rather irritable. 
	</ol><p>

<li>Extensive Verb
<li>Participle
<li>Gerund
<li>Infinitive
