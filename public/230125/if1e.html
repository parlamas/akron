  <b>Unwritten rules are difficult to understand</b></center><p>


Finally, it is not a good idea to offer your colleagues food out of your lunch box, but offering them sweets is quite acceptable. Don't expect your boss to start you on a task and show up at work on time. It takes a lot of work on your part, as a newly arrived refugee in Denmark, to find your way around the labor market as it is. Unwritten rules in particular can be difficult to tackle.<p>

These are rules that we tacitly follow and which are about what we expect from ourselves and each other when we go to work. This is the opinion of Mehmet Yüksekkaya, author of the book 'Unwritten rules on the Danish labor market,' an integration consultant and former official in the Norwegian Working Environment Authority. He claims that approximately 80 percent of everyday life on the job is governed by unwritten rules.<p>

A great many employers are not aware of how many informal rules there are. You become blind to them when you are born and raised with them, but for others they are neither logical nor obvious, he says.<p>

According to Mehmet Yüksekkaya, the amount of time it takes to crack the code varies depending on the individual.<p>

<b>Say it as it is</b><p>

An unwritten rule that can cause tension, according to Mehmet Yüksekkaya, is that Danes generally tend to wrap things up and serve a message between the lines, where it is largely about understanding the context in which things are said and how it is said. And sometimes things are not said at all because we are too shy of conflict.<p>

As a refugee in a workplace, you can make the same mistake many times without anyone saying anything. Instead of having a direct conversation, you might start talking about the person in question, and that creates a bad atmosphere and can have consequences for the well-being of the individuals involved, says Mehmet Yüksekkaya, who believes that honesty in the workplace would translate into more accommodating colleagues.<p>

The flat management structure we have in Denmark is also a situation where refugees can stumble in the work culture.<p>

In Denmark, we are self-driving and have freedom and responsibility, and it is expected that we take the initiative ourselves. Often we don't have much contact with the boss, who can almost be invisible. In many other places, the workplace culture is more hierarchical, and the boss has a more clear and controlling role, says Mehmet Yüksekkaya.<p>

This may mean that you, as a newcomer to the labor market, might wait to be started with a new task when you have finished the previous one, and only carry out tasks given by the boss and not tasks given by colleagues.<p>

It is not a sign of laziness on the newcomer's part, but a sign of respect for the boss. How things work is something that needs to be learned, and it is important to be clear about what is expected at the workplace, says Mehmet Yüksekkaya.<p>

<b>Five unwritten rules at work</b><p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>Understanding irony and humor</b> Danish irony can be sarcastic and sometimes very difficult for a foreigner to understand, and the Danes often use irony, humor and self-irony to convey hidden messages. If you don't understand the irony or the humor, you may feel offended or provoked.<p>

    <li><b>Eat lunch with your colleagues</b> It is expected to be social in the workplace and  eat lunch with one's colleagues. Finally, do not share out of the lunch box, but rather share the candy.<p>

    <li><b>Religion is a private matter</b> Most Danes perceive religion as a private matter and keep religion strictly separate from their work.<p>

    <li><b>Ask if you are in doubt</b> In Denmark it is ok to ask your colleagues or your boss if you are in doubt about something. In many other cultures it is perceived as a sign of weakness and ignorance.<p>

    <li><b>Be punctual and honor agreements</b> If there is something that annoys most Danes, it is if you don't show up on time or don't honor your agreements.<p>
