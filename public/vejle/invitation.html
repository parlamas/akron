      The concepts of <span class="b">Dialectics</span> and
      <span class="b">Horistics</span> are the cornerstones of
      <span class="b">Debating</span>, which were first laid out by Socrates in
      Plato's works.
      <p>
        True, dialectic debating has nothing to do with the usual presidential
        candidacy showmanship on TV or rhetoric.

      <p>You read, you hear, you see, you watch, but can you make sense?</p>

      <p></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Can you tell between knowledge and ignorance?
          <p>
            <li>
              Can you tell a demagogue from a true politician?
              <p>
                <li>
                  Can you tell lies from truth?
                  <p>
                    <li>
                      Can you tell between an honest mistake and a deliberate
                      attempt to mislead or even defraud?
                      <p>
                        <li>
                          And, above all, can you build credible, irrefutable
                          arguments that can withstand rigorous scrutiny to
                          support your position on any issue?
                        </li>
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </p>
                </li>
              </p>
            </li>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      What about <u>concept literacy</u>?
      <p>
        Can you define the concepts which are important to you like
        <i
          >love, loyalty, democracy, freedom, friendship, education, politics,
          justice, truth, hypocrisy</i
        >
        et al?
      </p>

      <p>
        Debating is about learning how to put in place logical filters, which
        would clearly show you what is true and what is false, what can stand to
        reason and what cannot, what advances Quality of Life and what does
        not...
