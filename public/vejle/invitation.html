<div style="width:100%; text-align:justify;">
        The concepts of <span class="b">Dialectics</span> and <span class="b">Horistics</span> are the cornerstones of <span class="b">Debating</span>, which were first laid out by Socrates in Plato's works.<p>

        True, dialectic debating has nothing to do with the usual presidential candidacy showmanship on TV or rhetoric.<p>

        You read, you hear, you see, but can you make sense?<p>

            <ul>
        <li>Can you tell between knowledge and ignorance?<p>
        <li>Can you tell a demagogue from a true politician?<p>
        <li>Can you tell lies from truth?<p>
        <li>Can you tell between an honest mistake and a deliberate attempt to mislead or even defraud?<p>
        <li>And, above all, can you build credible, irrefutable arguments that can withstand rigorous scrutiny to support your position on any issue?
            </ul>

        
        What about <u>conceptual literacy</u>?<p>

        Can you define the concepts which are important to you like <i>love, loyalty, democracy, friendship, education, politics, justice, truth, hypocrisy</i> et al?<p>



        Debating is about learning how to put in place logical filters, which would clearly show you what is true and what is false, what can stand to reason and what cannot, what advances Quality of Life and what does not...<p>
