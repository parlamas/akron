        <ol>

            <li><b>18:00 - 18:30 &rarr; Arrival of Participants & Group Formation</b><p>

                On arrival, the participants sit down spontaneously in groups of four (4) at designated tables each assigned a letter (A, B, C, D etc.).<p>

            <li><b>18:15 - 18:30 &rarr; A Very Brief Introduction to Debating</b><p>

                From 18:15 to 18:30, I introduce the core elements of Debating. (Loudspeakers would help a lot but they are not necessary.)<p>

            <li><b>18:30 - 18:45 &rarr; Topic to be Discussed is Chosen.</b><p>

                On the topic list, each group member should:

                <ol type=i>
                 <li>write their group letter<p>
                 <li>write their first name<p>
                 <li>check <span class="r">3</span> topics <b>only</b>
                </ol><p>

            <li><b>18:45 - 19:00 &rarr; Chosen Topic Announced.</b><p>

                Checked topics are submitted and counted and the <b>one chosen</b> topic is announced.<p>

            <li><b>19:00 - 20:15 &rarr; Topic is Defined.</b><p>

                Members of each group discuss how best the topic under discussion is to be defined.<p>

                Groups actually have to formulate in writing a definition of the chosen topic.<p>

                In the example of <b>love</b>, the following question needs to be answered:<p>

                    <b>What is love?</b><p>

                The definition is supposed to start like this:<p>

                <b>Love</b> is ... <p>

                Not all statements are definitions.<p>

                Here are the most basic, but not all, prerequisites for a definition to be valid:<p>

                    <ol type=a>
                        <li>It must be short...as a rule of thumb, 30 words maximum. The shorter the definition the better.<p>
                        <li>The defined term as well as all derivatives of it cannot be part of the definition.<p>
                            If, for example, topic <b>love</b> was chosen, <i>love, loving, loved, lovable, unloved, in love</i>, cannot be part of the definition.<p>
                        <li>The words used in the definition should be common vocabulary unless it is a scientific term.<p>
                        <li>Every effort should be made so that no other concept fits into the definition other than the defined topic.
                    </ol><p>

            <li><b>20:15 - 20:45 &rarr; Evaluation of Definitions</b><p>

                Groups are handed all submitted definitions; they evaluate them and they ultimately vote for the definition they find to be most apposite (= <i>tr√¶ffende, velvalgt</i>).<p>

            <li><b>20:45 - 21:00 &rarr; The Chosen Definition is Announced.</b><p>

                The votes are counted and the chosen definition, as well as the group associated with it, are announced.

        </ol><hr>

        <center><b>EPILOG</b><p>next session</center><p>

         I announce to the participants that in the next session we will be revisiting today's defined topic and analyze in depth the <i>what's</i> <i>how's</i> <i>why's</i> of each definition that the groups submitted, exposing fallacies, shortcomings, inconsistencies etc.<p>

        Then, we will tackle the idea that a definition cannot be valid unless it can be readily used as <u>a logical filter</u> and/or <u>a measure</u> of any claim that invokes the concept in question.<p>

        For example, if someone claims that <b>justice</b> has been done, we invoke the definition of <b>justice</b> to see if their claim stands to reason.<p>

                Finally, we will arrive at an improved and, hopefully, <u>irrefutable</u> defintion of the topic debated in the 1st session.
